abstract: In this paper we investigate geometric properties and modeling capabilities of quad meshes with planar faces whose mesh polylines enjoy the additional property of being contained in a single plane. This planarity is a major benefit in architectural design and building construction: if a structural element is contained in a plane, it can be manufactured on the ground without scaffolding and put into place as a whole. Further, the plane it is contained in serves as part of a so-called support structure. We discuss design of meshes under the requirement that one half of mesh polylines are planar (P-meshes), and we also investigate the geometry and design of meshes where all polylines enjoy this property (PP-meshes). We work in the space of planes and with appropriate transformations of that space. We also incorporate further properties relevant for architectural design, such as near-rectangular panels and repetitive nodes. We provide geometric insights, give explicit constructions, and show an approach to geometric modeling of both P-meshes and PP-meshes, in particular the case of nearly rectangular panels.
