abstract: This paper introduces an interactive design method for developable surfaces, centered on a datadriven approach to optimize surface patches for developability. Surface patches are the fundamental components of an entire surface, typically represented by triangular meshes. We propose a novel learning-based method that effectively transforms patches with arbitrary boundaries into their closest developable surfaces. Based on this method, our tools enable real-time, drag-and-drop design of developable surfaces and support piecewise developable approximation through interactive inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that this method provides a fast computational foundation for the interactive design of developable surfaces, enhancing design flexibility while exhibiting excellent robustness and generalization. The piecewise developable approximation of the model, guided by human-computer collaborative segmentation, achieved higher overall approximation accuracy, fewer patches, and lifelike papercraft outcomes. This offers greater flexibility to meet the application requirements of complex real-world scenarios and provides a new paradigm for integrating deep learning with interactive geometry design.
