I am a third-year graduate student at [Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics](http://www.aiar.xjtu.edu.cn/) of [Xi’an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/) in China, supervised by Caigui Jiang professor. My research interests are in Deep Learning model compression and hardware-software co-design. Badminton is all you need!
