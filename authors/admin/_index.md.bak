I am a professor at [Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics](http://www.iair.xjtu.edu.cn/) of [Xi’an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/) in China. Before that, I worked as a research scientist and Postdoc at [Visual Computing Center](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/vcc) (VCC) of [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology](https://www.kaust.edu.sa) (KAUST), [ICSI, UC Berkeley](https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/) and [the Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home). I obtained my Ph.D. from KAUST under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Helmut Pottmann](https://www.geometrie.tuwien.ac.at/pottmann/) and [Prof. Dr. Peter Wonka](http://peterwonka.net/). I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees from [Xi’an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/) (XJTU) in 2008 and 2011 respectively. My research interests are in geometric modeling, geometry processing, architectural geometry, computer graphics, and computer vision.
